# Home-PC Session 51 Handover — 2026-05-01

Short triage session, kicked off by "my koda stopped working wtf." Boss
had hit Koda mid-demo on Alex's main PC and gotten silent transcripts.
Root cause turned out to be hardware, not software: the Fifine USB mic
has a mute button on the **underside** of the base, and grabbing the
mic to reposition it had toggled mute. Diagnosis path took 4 messages
end-to-end. Side discovery — the home PC was still on installed v4.3.1
when v4.4.0-beta1 has been the current build since session 50 — fixed
by launching the existing `KodaSetup-4.4.0-beta1.exe` installer that
was sitting unused in `dist/`. Logged a follow-up to harden the
installer for friction-free upgrades.

## Branch
`feat/overlay-rounded-buttons` at `43d9460` (1 commit ahead of session
50's `a0311bc`, pushed). Working tree dirty: `M config.json` — known
carried state per session 45 rule, intentionally NOT committed.

## What Was Built This Session

### Diagnosis
- Read `C:\Users\alex\Projects\koda\debug.log` (11,732 lines, source-build
  log) and `C:\Users\alex\AppData\Roaming\Koda\debug.log` (2,476 lines,
  installed-exe log) and pieced together the timeline:
  - 12:02 — source v4.4.0-beta1 transcribed cleanly (9.59s on a 1-min clip)
  - 12:51 — single transcribe took 13.27s with `[WARNING] Slow transcription… Likely CPU-starved`
  - 12:51:39 → 12:53:46 — six consecutive `Whisper raw: ''` (silent audio)
  - 12:54:02 — source Koda shutdown
  - 12:54:19 — installed v4.3.1 launched (different hotkey set: `ctrl+shift+.` / `ctrl+shift+z` / `ctrl+alt+r` / `ctrl+alt+t`)
  - 12:54:29 + 12:54:34 — also empty Whisper outputs
- Beep + beep but no transcript = audio capture pipeline working, mic
  receiving silence. Not a Koda bug, not a config bug.

### Process cleanup
- Killed 5 lingering processes (3 × `Koda.exe`, 2 × `python.exe`) via
  `Stop-Process -Name Koda -Force` + `Stop-Process -Id <pid>`. The
  zombies were leftover from the source-build instance that didn't
  fully die at shutdown.

### v4.3.1 → v4.4.0-beta1 upgrade on main PC
- Verified `C:\Users\alex\Projects\koda\dist\KodaSetup-4.4.0-beta1.exe`
  exists (560,521,859 bytes, dated 2026-04-30 20:16 — built session 50).
- Read `installer/koda.iss` to confirm safe-upgrade behavior:
  - Same `AppId` ({{B7E3F2A1-8C4D-4E5F-9A6B-1C2D3E4F5A6B}) → single
    Add/Remove Programs entry, no duplicate icon.
  - Same `DefaultDirName` (`{autopf}\Koda` = `C:\Program Files\Koda`)
    → install dir overwrites in place.
  - Single `[Icons]` desktop entry at `{commondesktop}\Koda` → reuses
    existing shortcut path.
- Launched installer via `Start-Process -FilePath ...KodaSetup-4.4.0-beta1.exe`.
  UAC-elevated by user. Wizard run completion is between Alex and the
  installer — not log-confirmed at handover time.

### Installer-friction follow-up logged
- Appended new item to `.claude/next.md` under "Small fixes":
  > **Tighten `koda.iss` for friction-free upgrades** — installer
  > currently errors / prompts if Koda is running during upgrade. Add to
  > `[Setup]`: `CloseApplications=yes`, `RestartApplications=yes`,
  > `AppMutex=KodaSingleInstance` (and add the matching mutex to Koda
  > main loop). Result: re-running the installer over an existing
  > install closes Koda, swaps the exe, relaunches — no prompts, no
  > manual kill.
- Committed as `43d9460` and pushed to `origin/feat/overlay-rounded-buttons`.

## Decisions Made

### Don't commit `config.json`
- Working-tree diff includes `llm_polish.enabled: true` with model
  `llama3.2:1b` set as default. The repo's `config.json` ships to new
  installs via `[Files] ... Flags: ignoreversion onlyifdoesntexist` —
  if those defaults shipped, every fresh install would require Ollama
  with `llama3.2:1b` to function without errors.
- This matches session 45's existing rule (called out in session 50's
  handover): config.json is treated as carried local state, not
  authoritative defaults.
- Action: skipped from the commit. Working tree still shows
  `M config.json` and that's intentional.

### Physical fix for the mute button: tape it down
- Considered software-disable for the Fifine mute button. Rejected:
  it's a hardware switch on the USB device, no driver hook, no Fifine
  companion app for Alex's model. Tape over the underside button is the
  fastest and most foolproof permanent fix. Boom-arm reposition (so the
  mic body never gets grabbed) is the longer-term ergonomics move if
  Alex has a boom available.

### Installer-friction is a real follow-up, but not blocking the boss demo
- The four-line `koda.iss` tighten-up (`CloseApplications`,
  `RestartApplications`, `AppMutex`) is genuine UX debt and would
  remove the "uninstall older version first?" prompt entirely on
  upgrade. But it's not a v4.4.0-beta1-blocker — current upgrade flow
  works, just with one extra prompt. Logged as a follow-up, not pulled
  into this session.

## User Feedback & Corrections

Quoted verbatim from the conversation, with attribution:

- *"like if I say update this that and the other then we should install
  the latest and greatest here my boss just tried to use it and it
  fucking broke that is embarassing"*
  → Lesson: when Alex says "ship/update" on a build, the latest installer
  should also land on his **main PC** — not just be sitting in `dist/`
  for the coworker. Main PC is demo surface for boss; quality bar is
  higher than coworker share. Captured in the handover file but not as
  a memory entry — it's a one-shot lesson, already addressed by
  installing v4.4.0-beta1 here.

- *"like the installer should find install version and updated if
  anything"*
  → Validated correct expectation. Same `AppId` already gives clean
  upgrade-in-place behavior. The four-line tighten-up adds full
  automation (close + relaunch). Logged in next.md as `koda.iss`
  follow-up.

- *"the stupid microphone had the mute button underneath i want to grab
  the to move it muted it"*
  → Captured to memory as `reference_fifine_mic_mute.md` so future
  empty-Whisper symptoms get the mute-button check before the
  log-spelunking. Saves ~20 minutes of diagnosis.

## Dead Ends Explored

- **Default mic device wrong (Fifine vs NexiGo webcam)**: considered
  this when `Get-PnpDevice` listed both as active audio endpoints.
  Rejected — Alex confirmed Fifine USB was set as default in Sound
  settings. Default-device routing was not the culprit.

## Skills Activated This Session

| Skill | Ask | Outcome | Report path |
|---|---|---|---|
| forge-handover | "commit and push and handover skill — too much going on" | Single-project handover (this file) + commit + push | n/a (this file) |

No forge-deslop, forge-review, or forge-clean ran — pre-push gate is
opt-in for solo projects per global CLAUDE.md, and Alex explicitly
authorized the push.

## Memory Updates

Memory directory: `C:\Users\alex\.claude\projects\C--Users-alex\memory\`

- **CREATED:** `reference_fifine_mic_mute.md` — Fifine USB mic mute is
  on the underside; gets bumped when grabbing the mic to reposition.
  Symptom: hotkey beeps both ends, but Whisper returns empty strings.
  Diagnostic shortcut: check the bottom of the mic before reading logs.
- **UPDATED:** `MEMORY.md` index — appended one-line pointer to the
  new entry.

No other memory entries proposed. The "main PC needs latest installer"
lesson is one-shot (already actioned). The koda.iss tighten-up belongs
in `.claude/next.md`, not memory.

## Waiting On

- v4.4.0-beta1 installer wizard completion on home PC. Not log-confirmed
  at handover time. Alex will see the new build's hotkey set
  (`ctrl+space` / `f8` / `ctrl+f9` / `f7` / `f6` / `f5`) and the Atlas
  Navy overlay once it finishes.
- Alex to physically tape the Fifine underside button.

## Next Session Priorities

From `.claude/next.md` ship sequence (locked 2026-04-24, unchanged this
session):

1. **PR 1** — finish live mic test of `feat/prompt-assist-v2` → merge
   → tag `v4.4.0-beta1`. Re-run from source via `.\start.bat` with all
   six live-test fixes + auto-polish + Atlas Navy overlay (WIP commit
   `7440cfd` — visually untested, must eyeball before merge).
2. **PR 2** — `feat/piper-tts` — Piper direct subprocess, Amy as stock
   voice.
3. **PR 3** — `feat/koda-signature-voice` — Alex's wife's voice as Koda
   default.

New small fix added this session:
- **`koda.iss` friction-free upgrades** — `CloseApplications=yes`,
  `RestartApplications=yes`, `AppMutex=KodaSingleInstance` + matching
  mutex in Koda main loop. Roughly 4 lines of `[Setup]` + ~5 lines in
  `voice.py` or wherever the mainloop is. Trivial. Worth doing before
  the next coworker share so re-share UX is silent.

## Files Changed

- `C:\Users\alex\Projects\koda\.claude\next.md` — appended `koda.iss`
  tighten-up follow-up. Committed `43d9460`, pushed.
- `C:\Users\alex\Projects\koda\config.json` — modified pre-session,
  intentionally NOT committed (carried local state per session 45 rule).
- `C:\Users\alex\.claude\projects\C--Users-alex\memory\reference_fifine_mic_mute.md` — new memory file (outside git).
- `C:\Users\alex\.claude\projects\C--Users-alex\memory\MEMORY.md` —
  index updated (outside git).
- `C:\Users\alex\Projects\koda\docs\sessions\alex-session-51-home-pc-handover.md` — this file.

## Key Reminders

- **Empty Whisper output → check the mic mute button on the Fifine
  before anything else.** Hardware-side cause masquerades as software
  bug. ~20 minutes of log-spelunking saved per occurrence.
- **`config.json` working-tree diff is intentional, not pending work.**
  Carried since session 48 per session 45 rule. Do not "tidy up" by
  committing it — would ship Ollama as a hard dependency to fresh
  installs.
- **Main PC is demo surface for boss.** When a new installer is built
  for coworker share, also install it on the main PC so it's ready for
  any next demo. Don't let `KodaSetup-X.exe` sit in `dist/` while main
  PC runs the previous version.
- **Pre-push gate is opt-in for koda** (solo project per global
  CLAUDE.md). Alex authorized the push directly this session, so no
  forge-deslop / forge-review run was required.

## Migration Status

n/a — koda is a desktop app, no DB migrations.

## Test Status

No tests run this session (no source code changed). Baseline from
session 50: 431/431 tests passing on `feat/overlay-rounded-buttons`.

## Post-handover research — Whisper speed gap

After the main handover landed, Alex asked for deep research on why Koda
is slower than the boss's $120/yr "lightning fast" voice service. A
background `general-purpose` Agent ran 256s, hit 16+ web sources, and
wrote a 2,768-word write-up at:

`C:\Users\alex\Projects\koda\docs\research\whisper-speed-analysis-2026-05-01.md`

**Headline findings:**

- **The boss's tool is Wispr Flow** ($12/mo annual = $144/yr, high
  confidence). Engineering target `<700ms` end-to-end via Baseten cloud
  GPUs running fine-tuned Llama-class models with TensorRT-LLM.
- **The gap is fundamental hardware.** Koda runs `small` int8 on Intel
  UHD 770 + 4 CPU threads at 5–10× real-time. Whisper inference is
  >97% of every transcribe (concat = 0ms always). Koda's plumbing is
  not leaving major performance on the table — the published
  faster-whisper benchmark on a beefier 12700K hits the same multiplier.
- **Surprise:** `config.json` says `streaming: true`, but reading
  `voice.py:832-855`, Koda streams the *tray-tooltip preview* every 2s
  during recording — not the *paste*. Final paste re-transcribes from
  scratch via `_transcribe_and_paste()` at line 929. Wispr Flow's "no
  matter the length" feel comes from real paste-time streaming.

**Top 3 levers (research-validated):**

1. **Opt-in Groq cloud backend** — `whisper-large-v3-turbo`, 216×
   real-time, $0.04/hr or generous free tier. ~150 LOC + settings
   toggle. Local CPU stays the privacy default. **Only lever that
   actually closes the gap.**
2. **A/B `cpu_threads` at 1 and 8** before anything else — faster-whisper
   issue #526 documents 4 as pessimal on Intel parts. UHD 770 host has
   E+P cores, so 6 (P-core count) or 8 (P-core threads) is the likely
   optimum. Trivial test, possibly free 1.5–2×.
3. **"Speed mode" toggle: `small` → `tiny`** — 3–6× faster, ~12% WER
   hit. Per-mode toggle (chat-message dictation OK; prompt-assist not OK
   because LLM amplifies misheard words).

**Don't do (research-validated negatives):**
- Ship `large-v3-turbo` on local CPU — counterintuitively *slower* than
  `small` on CPU.
- Switch default model from `small` → `tiny` for everyone — accuracy
  hit too steep for prompt-assist.
- Rebuild on OpenVINO until cloud lever is done — heavy refactor for
  ~2× when cloud gives 50×.

**Memory entry created:**
`reference_koda_speed_gap.md` — durable conclusion so a future session
doesn't re-research the same question.

`.claude/next.md` updated with three concrete sub-items under the
existing "Transcription speed gap" entry.
